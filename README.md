# The Park

Welcome to The Park, an immersive multi-POV zombie shooter game made using Unreal Engine 5. This repository hosts the C++ core files and Blueprint scripts, providing a glimpse into the solid core functions such as:
- Character logic
- Zombie AI logic
- Weapon and its all functions
- Inventory system

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Unreal Engine (at least version 5.1)
- A compatible C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up The Park on your system:

1. **Create an empty project in UE 5 (C++)**
2. **Clone the repository in the source folder**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manglam27/the_park.git
   ```
3. **Move the content folder from the source to the UE 5 content folder**, as it contains all the necessary logic blueprint files.
4. **Using Visual Studio, build the C++ code and tweak the code according to your needs.**
5. **After a successful build, your project is ready to go.**
   (Note: This file only contains code and logic; none of the assets or material files are included due to size limitations. You will need to manually change all the necessary meshes to use these files.)

   My advice is to use these files as a reference to build yours. :)
